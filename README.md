# A cute hexapod pet 

This repository hosts the research and development plan for building an advanced hexapod robot enhanced with ROS (Robot Operating System) integration. The project is designed for individuals with a strong mathematical background who are new to electronics and programming, guiding you through a step-by-step learning process from foundational skills to a fully autonomous, interactive robot.

Repo is currently being documented in obsidian. When I make progress, more info will be updated here.

## Overview

The project leverages ROS to simplify complex robotics tasks, enable code reuse, and provide powerful tools for visualization and debugging. By following the structured phases outlined in this plan, you will:
- Learn essential electronics, programming, and Linux operations.
- Master hardware platforms such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
- Develop computer vision, sensor fusion, and autonomous navigation capabilities.
- Implement coordinated movement using Central Pattern Generators (CPG) and advanced gait algorithms.
- Integrate human interaction features like voice recognition and emotional expression.
- Optimize and integrate all subsystems into a cohesive, high-performance robotics platform.

## Features

- **ROS Integration:** Utilize ROS Noetic for standardization, debugging, and system management.
- **Foundational Learning:** Gain hands-on experience with basic electronics, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Linux.
- **Vision & Sensing:** Implement computer vision with OpenCV, LiDAR mapping, sensor fusion, and Hailo AI acceleration.
- **Advanced Movement:** Develop CPG-based leg control, explore gait patterns, and utilize ROS control frameworks.
- **Autonomous Capabilities:** Create terrain-adaptive movement, SLAM-based navigation, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Human Interaction:** Integrate voice recognition, text-to-speech, emotional expression, and adaptive behaviors.
- **System Integration:** Optimize power management, performance, and user interfaces with comprehensive testing and documentation.
